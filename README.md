A Naval Battle Game to run in bash.
You must have Node.js installed on your computer.
Simple one-sided game of battleships against the computer. The optimal grid size is 10. You can choose a grid with up to 26x26 cases but the interface isn't really nice and the ship won't be displayed really randomly. The computer has 1 battleship (5 squares) and 2 destroyers(4 squares) that you must seek. All other instructions are in game. Enjoy !
